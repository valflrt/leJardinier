# Le Jardinier (typescript)

This is simple simple discord bot made in typescript with discord.js.

### Installation

First, you'll need to download/clone this repository from github. Then enter the folder and run `npm install`

### Configuration

In order to get the code working, you'll need to get a bot token ([learn more](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/)), add it in [secrets.example.ts](./src/config/secrets.example.ts) and then rename this file to `secrets.ts`.

### Starting

Finally, to start the code, run:

-   `npm start` for normal start
-   `npm run dev` for development start (with nodemon: restarting when code changes)

You can also use the command below to lint the code in `src`:

-   `npm run lint`

### Notes

-   You need to have npm and node installed on your computer
-   [typescript.ts](./typescript.ts) is useless, i added it because my code editor put an error and adding this file was the way to fix it...
-   _Don't mind my code it can be fucked up sometimes..._
