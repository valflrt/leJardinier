# lejardinier-typescript
This is simple simple discord bot made in typescript with discord.js.

### Installation

First, you'll need to download/clone this repository from github. Then enter the folder and run `npm install`

### Configuration

In order to get the code working, you'll need to get a bot token ([learn more](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/)), add it in [token.example.ts](./src/config/token.example.ts) and then rename this file to `token.ts`.

### Starting

Finally, to start the code, run:
- `npm start` for normal start
- `npm run dev` for development start (with nodemon: restarting when code changes)

### Notes

- You need to have npm and node installed on your computer
- [typescript.ts](./typescript.ts) is useless, i added it because my code editor put an error and adding this file was the way to fix it...
- *Don't mind my code it can be fucked up sometimes...*
